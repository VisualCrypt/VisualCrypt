    <!-- Make sure to have this attribute in AssemblyInfo.cs:
    [assembly: ThemeInfo(ResourceDictionaryLocation.None, ResourceDictionaryLocation.SourceAssembly)] 
    It's then not necessary to load this ResourceDictionary in App.xaml, MainWindow.xaml etc.,
    however, ResourceDictionarys containing DynamicResources, such as colors must be explicitly loaded.
    Index all Styles that are part of the 'Generic' theme here: -->
