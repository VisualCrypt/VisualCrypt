# VisualCrypt

VisualCrypt is a password-based encryption protocol and cross-platform message format with implementations for Windows, Android and iOS. 

The VisualCrypt Apps use the VisualCrypt protocol for the exchange of encrypted messages, notetaking and storage of precious secrets in simple .visualcrypt-files that can exist independedly of any app or service account.

Pending some further reviews and changes, VisualCrypt aims to be the world's strongest password-based encryption scheme. The messages (in isolation from the possibly compromised system where they were created) should be unbreakable, allowing for the careless storage of secrets in the cloud, on your devices or in your WhatsApp inbox.

Clone the code and see what we are doing! While the mobile apps still need some work, the version for the Windows Desktop is already in pretty good shape.
